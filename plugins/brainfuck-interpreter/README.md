# Brainfuck Interpreter Plugin
As the name suggests, it runs any Brainfuck code you have typed into the active document. Write some Brainfuck code and go to Plugins -> Brainfuck Interpreter -> Interpret Open Document to see it in action!

Good for seeing how to make more advanced NotepadPy++ plugin projects, as well as playing with Brainfuck (which I'm personally quite a fan of).
